# Linear Partition (LP2) Problem

## Problem Statement:
- Given a sequence S of n positive integers (s1, s2, â€¦, sn) and an integer k, partition S into k ranges so as to maximizes the minimum sum over all ranges.

## About:
- This was a project from a class called Algorithms (CSCI406) which is provided at the Colorado School of Mines.
- For this project we had to implment LP2 but Recursivally and though Dynamic Programming. 
- The recursive implementation was implmented by me, Mehmet, though alot of testing and troubleshooting.
- The Dynamic Programming implementation was provided by Steven S. Skiena in his book: "The Algorithm Design Manual". The algorithm/pseudocode is described by Skiena in Chapter 8 (Dynamic Programming) in section 8.5 of his book. All I did was write Python code for the algorithm descirbed by Skiena. My code is NOT a one-to-one creation of that algorithm/pseudocode, I did do somethings different but MOST, if not all, is based on the algorithm/pseudocode described by Skiena in section 8.5.
- If you want to see the code and some more detail, please check out the Jupyter Notebook in this directory.
