# C-Programs

## About

Some scripts/projects I made using the C/C++ programming language

## Events

- I did not really do anything with C/C++ until early 2020.
- From early 2020 to the end of 2022, I really only used C/C++ for some of my college classes (mainly CSCI442).
- The goal is, 2023 going forward, is for me to do more C/C++ projects because currently I am really only comfortable/confident in interpreted languages like Python and Java-Script.

## Scripts/Projects

### reverse.c

- About: My own implementation of the tac command which just prints the content of a file but in reverse (opposite of the cat command).
- Requirements: c and gcc
- How To Run:
    ```
    # make reverse executable:
    gcc -o reverse reverse.c

    # run reverse:
    ./reverse <file_path>

    # example:
    ./reverse ./README.md
    ```

### tree.c

- About: My attempt of implementing the [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(command)) command.
- Requirements: c and gcc
- How To Run:
    ```
    # make reverse executable:
    gcc -o tree tree.c

    # run tree:
    ./tree
    ./tree <dir_path>
    ```
