# Simple 2D L-System Python Implmentation

## About:
- I always wanted to implment an L-System, so I did it.
- The main.py script generates the L-System and its where you can enter certain parameters for your L-System. Look for the parameters comment to see where you can enter these parameters.
- I also created a script taht converts eps files to png.
