# Python Implementation of Nearest Neighors & Optimal TSP for the Traveling Sales Man Problem
- Date: Spring 2020

## About:
- When I took Algorithms (CSCI406) at the Colorado School of Mines, we had a project where we had to analyze the Nearest Neighors & Optimal TSP algorithms.
- For this project, I implmented the two algorithms in Python3.
- The pseudocode was provided by my profressor at the time.
- In the code, Nearest Neighors was implmented twice. The first attempt seemed like it worked but after more testing, it failed. Due to this Nearest Neighors was implmented a 2nd time and it did not fail during testing.
- I good source I would like to recommand is a textbook by Steven S. Skiena called "The Algorithm Design Manual (Second Edition)". This textbook was used though the class and was most inspired this project for this class.
