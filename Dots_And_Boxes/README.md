# Dots & Boxes Analysis
- Date: 12-23-2020

## About:
- The goal of this challenge was to analyze the game: Dots & Boxes.
- To analyze this game, game trees where used.
- For a 1x1 game, the game tree was made by hand. But for any game after that, Python had to be used.

## Game's Analyzied:
- 1x1 Game
- 1x2 Game

## File Layout:
- ./1x1_game/1x1_dots_boxes_game_tree.png: 
	- Game tree and final conclusion for a 1x1 game.
- ./1x2_game/dots&boxes_1x2.ipynb:
	- Analysing 1x2 games by looking though every possible game state for a 1x2 game.
- ./complexity_analysis.ipynb: 
	- Analysis the complexity of the Dots & Boxes game. Determine how many possible moves and how many possible game states exist for a NxM game of Dots & Boxes.
- ./README.md:
	- The README for this challenge.
