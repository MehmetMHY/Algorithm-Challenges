# Algorithm Challenges - Mehmet Yilmaz

## About:
- This is a collection of algorithms I have done for school assignments, online coding challenges/problems, and personal projects.
- To see and/or use most of these algorithms, you we will need Jupyter Notebook:
  ```
  pip3 install notebook
  ```

## Table of Context:
- <ins>C Programs:</ins>
  - About: Some scripts/projects I made using the C/C++ programming lanaguage

- <ins>Jumping Jims Encore:</ins>
  - About: Its an interesting graph problem. To see all the details, please view: Jumping-Jims-Encore-Problem/README.md
  - Requirements:
    - Python3
    - matplotlib
    - networkx
  
- <ins>Linear Partition 2 (LP2):</ins>
  - About: Both a recursive and dynamic programming solution to the following problem statement:  
    * Given a sequence S of n positive integers (s1, s2, â€¦, sn) and an integer k, partition S into k ranges so as to maximizes the minimum sum over all ranges.
  - Requirements:
    - Python3
    - numpy

- <ins>Traveling Salesman Problem:</ins>
