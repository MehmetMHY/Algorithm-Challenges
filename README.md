## About:
- This is a collection of algorithms I have done for school assignments, online coding challenges/problems, and personal projects.
- To see and/or use most of these algorithms, we will need Jupyter Notebook.

## Table of Context:
- L System:
  - About: A simple L-System generator. To learn more about L-Systems, you can refer to this source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system
  - Requirements:
    - Python3
    - turtle
    - tkinter
  
- Linear Partition 2 (LP2):
  - Both a recursive and dynamic programming solution to the following problem statement:  
    * Given a sequence S of n positive integers (s1, s2, â€¦, sn) and an integer k, partition S into k ranges so as to maximizes the minimum sum over all ranges.
  - Requirements:
    - Python3
    - numpy
- Traveling Salesman Problem:
  - Implementations of the Nearest Neighbor and Optimal_TSP algorithms for the traveling salesman problem.
  - Requirements:
    - Python3
- Website Challenges/Problems:
